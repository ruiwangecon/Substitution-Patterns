# Substitution-Patterns
These are Python and Julia codes for the paper "Testing and Identifying Substitution and Complementarity Patterns." The latest version of the working paper can be found in this repository.

This code implements four different estimators for the structural demand estimation model: (i) the two-step estimator proposed in this paper, (ii) the mixed effect parametric estimator, (iii) the fixed effect logit estimator without bundles, and (iv) the nonparametric estimator without bundles. More details about the four estimators are available in the paper.
