# Code for "Testing and Identifying Substitution and Complementarity Patterns"

This repository contains Python and Julia scripts used in the paper "Testing and Identifying Substitution and Complementarity Patterns." You can find the latest version of the working paper here.

The code implements four different estimators for the structural demand estimation model: (i) the two-step estimator proposed in this paper, (ii) the mixed effect parametric estimator, (iii) the fixed effect logit estimator without bundles, and (iv) the nonparametric estimator without bundles. More details about the four estimators are available in the paper.
